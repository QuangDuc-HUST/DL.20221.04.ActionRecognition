# Deep Learning Project
# Action Recognition - Group 04 - DSAI K65 - HUST 
*The project structure is inspired by [cs230-stanford course](https://github.com/cs230-stanford/cs230-code-examples).*

**Note: All the code need to run in this directory.* 

*All the code should be run on one of three platforms Linux OS, Google Colab, and Kaggle.*

## Code Execution   
Our project has two versions: *Linux Environment* and *Google Colab environment* (link) (basically they are the same). 

However, we highly recommend to use Google Colab version because of its convenience (our dataset is about 20GB -> 200GB after extracting frames from video)

### Requirements
### Google Colab Version 

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](123)

*We used Google Colab Pro Version for this project so some problems may be occurred if you training on the large ( >100GB ) extracted frame dataset.*

Please follow the instructions on the Colab Version notebook
### Linux Environment

### Quick starts
*For more details, we also comment every details *


#### Build the simple `dataset` (download extracted frames data)
~ 20GB for the basic extracted frames dataset (for more dataset, please read in `build_dataset.py`)
```
```
#### `Training` the model. Simple run
```
```
#### `Evaluate` the model on the test set
```
```
